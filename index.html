            <h2>On Education and the Future</h2>
            <p>As of writing this in the summer of 2025 it seems that education has taken a dramatic turn since I began college back in Covid. Almost everyone I talk to is having AI do the majority of their work. When I talk to others about their education they joke about using ChatGPT and we both laugh and it's like nothing ever happened. Is this an atrocity or is this the exposure of how inefficient the actual educational system really is? Any educated person will tell you how much BS there was getting to where they are now. Why do I need to memorize L'Hopitals Rule? Why do I need to take a flute class that involves me buying a $120 dollar personalized flute from a local native from Corvallis, Oregon? We are taking what are supposed to be our brightest minds and subjecting them to the rubric of the educational system all while they milk us for 10's of thousands of dollars. Isn't this a shame! So much ambition and positivity that could be harnessed but we sit in classrooms that neglect our true desires.</p>
            <p>With AI I believe the future will be personalized and free. As data centers get constructed, robotics get advanced and access to LLM's become increasingly available, humans will finally be free to learn what they want at maximum efficiency because it will be their choice. This is obviously a huge shift from what we are used to presently. Having a free educational system that is as flexible as you want is a giant leap forward from what we have now but there are undoubtedly some uncertainties.</p>
            <p>From preschool up what will the future educational system look like when AGI is upon us? We will most likely put creative endeavors at the forefront of education. The pure creativity that makes humans different from any present LLM will be amplified. People will work hand in hand with AI making these ideas a reality which will be extremely easy. It's almost like AI will be a factory that takes in human ideas then transforms them into reality. Every human will be an entrepreneur or artist of some kind. With this in play how does the basic structure of society form? I believe that as long as humans are on this planet there will be some kind of inequality between individuals. No human is perfect and this is represented by how we currently live. This is important because with limited resources we need a way to distribute them effectively. This is impossible because it seems that humans' desire for resources and space is almost infinite. We will need to set up a new kind of structure that rewards ideas and gives resources to those with good ideas but also gives everyone an absolutely unparalleled standard of living. For example, if there was a person who didn't come up with one idea their entire life they would live a standard of living that was orders of magnitude higher than we live today. For the people that do come up with many great ideas that help everyone flourish we will need to reward them for their behaviour with some kind of currency. What that might be could be numerous things. It may be as simple as respect and self satisfaction. It could be something that we cannot conceive of today. This structure will create a highly personalized earth with each individual having a surplus of free time to spend with their family and do what they most desire if needed. It will also satisfy our relentless pursuit of new ideas.</p>
            <p>There are many issues with this idea of course. One being limited space. As humans gain access to unlimited resources we will increase our population. This will result in either humans having to compete for space using some type of economic model or we will need to innovate to create more space. This could take the shape of some kind of improved Metaverse model. I'm aware this all sounds like science fiction but literally nothing is off of the table when talking about the effects of AGI. These are just basic facts of our universe that we need to comply with. We could also find a way to inhabit other planets although sooner or later we will run into the same lack of space dilemma. The only way to truly eradicate the issue of limited space is to make it infinite.</p>

            <h2>The Global Race for Computation</h2>
            <p>As of writing this in the summer of 2025, it feels like the world is in the middle of a construction boom that nobody's really talking about. Not for housing, not for commercial real estate-but for data centers. These things are popping up everywhere. Microsoft's spending over $50 billion this year alone to build out infrastructure that can support Al growth. Amazon, Google, Meta-same story. It's like everyone woke up at once and realized the only way to survive the Al explosion is to own the digital land it lives on.</p>
            <p>And when I say land, I mean literal land. Thousands of acres are being scooped up across the U.S., Scandinavia, Chile, you name it. These aren't some sleek buildings you see in tech company promo videos. They're massive, power-hungry, water-cooled beasts. We're talking about server factories the size of airports. Places like Iowa and northern Sweden-once considered pretty off the radar-are turning into digital oil fields. Why? Because they've got space, power, and cool climates. All things you need when you're trying to run and cool a building stuffed with GPUs burning hotter than a jet engine.</p>
            <p>This is important. I don't think people fully get what this means. This isn't just about making sure ChatGPT doesn't go down during finals week. This is about reshaping the actual structure of the global economy. These data centers are becoming the foundation for a new kind of industrial revolution. One where human labor isn't the bottleneck-it's computing power. Every future business, government, artist, and engineer is going to be dependent on a cloud of infrastructure built right now. And it's not just about Al, it's about everything: logistics, health care, energy grids, education-name an industry and it's probably about to get eaten by a data-hungry algorithm.</p>
            <p>There's something poetic about it too. The cloud used to sound like this vague, magical thing. But it turns out it's made of concrete, steel, and wires. You can drive by it. It needs real people to build and run it. It consumes electricity like it's candy. It's messy. It's expensive. And it's absolutely necessary if we want to keep scaling the capabilities of Al.</p>
            <p>This is all happening really fast. And the consequences are going to be huge. The places that get ahead on this-places with smart energy policy, fast permitting, and cheap land-are going to explode economically. They're going to attract tech jobs, investment, and long-term relevance. Countries that miss out might find themselves on the wrong side of a new kind of digital divide. A few regions will control most of the compute power, and that's going to matter a lot more than oil did in the 20th century.</p>
            <p>So yeah, this might seem like a boring construction story. But it's not. It's the building of a new nervous system for the planet. And if you're someone who cares about the future-about education, access, equity, and innovation-then you should be paying very close attention to where these data centers are getting built and who controls them.</p>
